# MakersBnB Project Seed

This repo contains the seed codebase for the MakersBnB project in Ruby (using Sinatra and RSpec).

Someone in your team should fork this seed repo to their Github account. Everyone in the team should then clone this fork to their local machine to work on it.

This was the very first group project which used all the Ruby knowledge we had alongside web applications and server knowledge. In this we make our own version/replica of AirBnB using Sinatra, RSpec, PostgreSQL database and erb all within a week. 

We first started by working out what our MVP (Minimal Viable Product) would be and what would be the best way to achieve that. We made note of what features we wanted to get on there and then focussed on using pair programming in order to allow everyone invloved in the project to learn something new each time. 

A lot of our great communication grew from the use of a Trello board in order to keep track of what we needed to get done and the realistic time it would take to complete it. 

We followed the typical Test Driven Development process, which allowed this to have above 97% coverage rate and has testing for every aspect we could think of.

## Setup

```bash
# Install gems
bundle install

# Run the tests
rspec

# Run the server (better to do this in a separate terminal).
rackup
```
